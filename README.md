# GithubAppSolution
I recently registered for a free android tutorial course hosted by Andela and Udemy, this is the repo for the app assigned to me to build, A simple android app that fetches a list of github Java programmers in Lagos and does some other small things. If you find a bug no matter how small please contact!
